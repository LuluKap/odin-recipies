    <h1>2 Ingredient Pizza</h1>
    <img src="/images/pizza.jpg" alt="Pizza">
    <h2>A delicious pizza has an intensely cheesy flavor. The combination of tomato sauce and cheese creates a perfect marriage of flavor. The ingredients begin to brown during the baking process, which makes pizza taste so delicious.</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ¾ cups self-rising flour, plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>1 cup greek yogurt</li>
            <li>½ cup pizza sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, part-skim</li>
            <li>pepperoni slouse, for topping</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400°F(200°C).</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix the self-rising flour and Greek yogurt until it comes together to form a ball.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough ball to a lightly floured work surface and use your hands to begin flattening and shaping the rough into about a 12-inch (30 cm) round. If at any point the dough begins to stick, sprinkle on a bit more flour.</li>
            <li>Carefully transfer the dough to a lightly floured baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Spread the sauce evenly across the dough, sprinkle on the cheese, and top with pepperonis.</li>
            <li>Bake for 20 minutes, until the cheese has melted and the crust has turned golden-brown.</li>
            <li>Slice and serve.</li>
        </ol>
