    <h1>Fluffiest Pancakes</h1>
    <img src="/images/pancakes.jpg" alt="Pancakes">
    <h2>Pancakes are sweet, soft, and similar to cake-- but flat. Honestly, they taste more like dessert than breakfast. They can be made plain, or have things like fruit, nuts, chocolate, or other things inside or on top (personally, I like a little bit of peanut butter on them sometimes).</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>8 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 eggs, whites and yolks seperated</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
            <li>maple syrup, for serving</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, add the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda and whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl or liquid measuring cup, add the buttermilk, melted butter, and egg yolks and whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>Add the buttermilk mixture to the dry ingredients and gently fold with a rubber spatula until just combined.</li>
            <li>Add the egg whites and fold until just combined. Be sure not to overmix. Some lumps are okay.</li>
            <li>Let the batter rest for 15-30 minutes at room temperature.</li>
            <li>Add the butter to a cast iron skillet and heat over medium low heat. Once the butter has melted and is bubbling, reduce the heat to medium-low and add ⅓ cup (75 g) of batter to the pan.</li>
            <li>Cook for 2-3 minutes, until bubbles start to appear on the surface. Flip the pancake over and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until golden brown. Repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
            <li>Serve the pancakes with butter and maple syrup.</li>
        </ol>
